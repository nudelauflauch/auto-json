Guide:

In the blank white entry you write the name of the block or item
then you press the buttons, which sort of model it should be.
Then press "weiter" for the next or "start" to start
(if you mark that it is a item and something else it will always takes 
item)

For example if you have made a plank and want to make a slab, made out of the plank, 
too. You mark block, for the planks block, and slab. After that you press start.
Than you can generate the block and item model and the blockstat.
They are all found in output/your_mod_id/assets/your_mod_id/..
